Getting Started Guide

Installation:
-------------

1. Install the TGIT extension
2. Install TortoiseGIT (https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/)
3. Install MSysGit (http://msysgit.github.io/)
3. Be sure that the TortoiseGIT bin folder and MSysGit is in your PATH

Options:
--------

TGIT has two options: "Develop branch prefix" and "Feature branches prefix".
These two options determine the prefix of the branches used in the gitflow branching model.

These two options must be correctly set for the "Start New Feature" and "Finish Feature" menu items
to work.

Gitflow:
--------

So what exactly are those gitflow menu items doing?

- Start New Feature
	1. Switch to the develop branch
    2. Pull latest changes on develop
    3. Create and switch to a new branch

- Finish Feature
    1. Switch to the develop branch
    2. Pull latest changes on develop
    3. Merge the feature branch to develop
    4. Delete the local feature branch
    5. Delete the remote feature branch
    6. Push all changes to develop
